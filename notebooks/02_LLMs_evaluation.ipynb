    "# Evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) for Foundational Nature AI\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook outlines a structured approach to evaluating large language models (LLMs) as prototypes for a Foundational Nature AI. This initiative aims to leverage LLMs to inform questions about biodiversity and conservation, crucial for making real-world decisions. The concept emerged from the OpenNature initiative, a key output of the Nature Data Unlocked workshop held in Cambridge in late May. Proposed by Drew Purves at Google DeepMind, with Vizzuality offering technical implementation support, this project seeks to explore the potential of LLMs in environmental science and policy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The evaluation employs three distinct systems, each designed to test the capabilities and flexibility of LLMs under different conditions, specifically tailored to address issues related to biodiversity and conservation. The goal is to understand how these models perform in scenarios ranging from zero-shot learning to the utilization of customized information, with a focus on their application in environmental decision-making. Below is a detailed description of each system:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **System 1 (S1) - Zero-Shot Learning:** This approach evaluates the LLM's ability to understand and respond to queries about biodiversity and conservation without any prior specific training or context. It tests the model's inherent knowledge and its capacity to infer answers based on that knowledge, crucial for addressing unexpected or novel environmental issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **System 2 (S2) - Retrieval Augmented Generation:** This system introduces a default dossier or a set of background information related to environmental science into the prompt. The purpose is to assess how well the LLM can utilize additional context provided at the time of the query to enhance its responses. This tests the model's ability to integrate new, relevant information with its pre-existing knowledge base, a key factor in providing accurate and useful information for conservation efforts. The use of techniques like Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) could potentially enhance this process by dynamically retrieving and incorporating external knowledge sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **System 3 (S3) - Custom Dossier:** Unlike S2, which uses a generic set of information, S3 involves creating a custom dossier tailored to the specific query or topic at hand, related to biodiversity and conservation. This method aims to evaluate the LLM's performance when given highly relevant and targeted information, testing its ability to process and apply specific details to generate accurate and context-aware responses, essential for informed decision-making in environmental conservation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The evaluation of LLMs through these systems will provide insights into their adaptability, information processing capabilities, and overall performance in diverse scenarios related to environmental science and policy. This structured approach allows for a comprehensive assessment of LLMs as prototypes for a Foundational Nature AI, highlighting their strengths and areas for improvement in contributing to biodiversity and conservation efforts."

    "   - \"What is the significance of the Living Planet Index in monitoring biodiversity trends?\"\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### Description\n",
    "\n",
    "System 3 involves creating a custom dossier tailored to the specific query or topic at hand, related to biodiversity and conservation. This method aims to evaluate the LLM's performance when given highly relevant and targeted information, testing its ability to process and apply specific details to generate accurate and context-aware responses, essential for informed decision-making in environmental conservation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### [Tool calling agent](https://python.langchain.com/v0.1/docs/modules/agents/agent_types/tool_calling/)\n",
    "\n",
    "One possibility to create a custom \"dossier\" is to use a tool calling agent. This agent can interact with external tools or APIs to gather relevant information based on the query. For example, the agent could access databases of species information, conservation projects, or environmental policies to provide detailed and up-to-date data for the LLM to generate responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are several APIs available that provide information about the location and distribution of species. Here are a few notable ones:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **GBIF (Global Biodiversity Information Facility) API**:\n",
    "   - The GBIF API provides access to a vast amount of biodiversity data, including species occurrences and distributions.\n",
    "   - [GBIF API Documentation](https://www.gbif.org/developer/summary)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **iNaturalist API**:\n",
    "   - iNaturalist is a platform where users can share observations of biodiversity. The API allows access to data about species observations.\n",
    "   - [iNaturalist API Documentation](https://www.inaturalist.org/pages/api+reference)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Map of Life API**:\n",
    "   - Map of Life integrates diverse data sources to provide information on species distributions and biodiversity patterns.\n",
    "   - [Map of Life API Documentation](https://mol.org/api/)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **eBird API**:\n",
    "   - eBird is a platform for bird watchers to record sightings. The API provides data on bird species distributions and observations.\n",
    "   - [eBird API Documentation](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/664302/S1ENwy59)\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **VertNet API**:\n",
    "   - VertNet provides access to vertebrate biodiversity data, including specimen records and observation data.\n",
    "   - [VertNet API Documentation](https://github.com/VertNet/webapp/wiki/Introduction-to-the-VertNet-API)\n",
    "\n",
    "These APIs can provide detailed information about species' locations and distribution patterns. We can use them to query specific species and regions to gather the data we need.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### [Build Tool Calling Agent](https://blog.langchain.dev/tool-calling-with-langchain/)\n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs can interact with external data sources via tool calling functionality. Tool calling is a powerful technique that allows developers to build sophisticated applications that can leverage LLMs to access, interact and manipulate external resources like databases, files and APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical tool calling agent has three main components:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Initialize Tools:** First, we need to set up the tools that the agent will interact with.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Create Agent:** Next, we create the agent that will call these tools based on the user's query.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Invoke Agent:** Finally, we invoke the agent with a query to retrieve the relevant information from the external tools.\n",
